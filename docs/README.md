# Docs

Serve the mini site to browse the manuals locally:

- Open `docs/site/index.html` with a static server (e.g., VS Code “Live Server”).
- The viewer loads content from `docs/manuals/user-manual/...`.

Quick start (VS Code):
- Open this repo in VS Code
- Right–click `docs/site/index.html` → “Open with Live Server”

Other options:
- Any static server from the repo root also works, e.g. `npx serve` and open `/docs/site/index.html`.
