# Package Installers (Dist)

Create platform packages with electron-builder.

## All-in-one (host-based)
```bash
npm run dist
```
- Linux host: builds `.deb` and `.rpm`
- Windows host: builds `.exe` (NSIS)
- Artifacts in `release/<platform>/<arch>/`

## Linux details
```bash
sudo apt install -y fakeroot dpkg-dev rpm   # Ubuntu
npm ci
npm run dist
```
- DEB + RPM appear in `release/linux/x64/`
- If `rpmbuild` is missing, RPM is skipped

## Windows details
```powershell
npm ci
npm run dist
```
- NSIS installer in `release/win/x64/`
- If building on Linux via Wine, install `wine64` and `mono-complete`

## Naming & checksums
- Files named via electron-builder config in `package.json`
- Checksums generated by scripts in `scripts/*.mjs` (SHA256SUMS.txt)

## Common flags
- `npm run dist:linux` — Linux-only
- `npm run dist:win` — Windows-only (when on Windows)
