# Installation

Get SVG2Icon running in a couple of minutes.

## What you need
- Windows or Linux
- Packaged app: nothing extra required
- Dev build (optional): Node.js and npm

## Packaged app (recommended)
1. Download the installer for your OS (Windows installer or Linux .deb/.rpm).
2. Run the installer and open SVG2Icon from your apps menu.

That’s it — you’re ready to create your first project.

## Developer build (optional)
If you prefer to run from source:
1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Start the app with `npm run dev`

## Optional: macOS icon support on Windows/Linux
To produce `.icns` (macOS) while running on Windows or Linux, install one of:
- `npm i png2icons`
- or a CLI such as `png2icns` (Linux)

## Check it’s working
- Open the app — you should see an empty project table and the “New SVG” button.
