# Quick Start

Make your first icon set in a minute:

1. Click “New SVG”.
2. Drop or select your SVG.
3. Confirm the name (auto‑filled from the filename — you can edit).
4. Click “Create Project”.
5. In the project row, choose a download option: Web, Mobile, Desktop, or All.
6. Save the ZIP. A notification appears in the bottom‑right when your files are ready.

Tip: You can always download the original SVG from the row’s “SVG” button later.
