# Themes

Choose the appearance that works best for you. Theme changes apply instantly and persist between sessions.

> Tip: New to Settings? See [Opening Settings](opening-settings.md) for the toolbar button, menu path, and keyboard shortcut.

## Pick a Theme
In the Appearance section, click a theme:
- Light — Bright, high contrast
- System — Follows your OS preference (auto‑switches)
- Dark — Dim for low‑light environments

> Tip: System follows your operating system and updates automatically when your OS switches between light/dark.

## Done
Close the dialog. Your choice is saved and used on next launch.

> Remember: The app also updates the window’s theme color for better OS/browser integration.
