> Warning: No macOS `icon.icns` file? Install `png2icons` (Node) or use `iconutil` on macOS / `png2icns` on Linux, then regenerate.

- Can’t write files
  - Pick a folder you can write to (e.g., your Documents folder)

- “require is not defined” during development
  - We use ESM in dev; restart `npm run dev` after updates
- GTK chooser warnings on Linux
  - Benign toolkit logs — file picker still works
