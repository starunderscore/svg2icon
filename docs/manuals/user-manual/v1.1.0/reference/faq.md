# FAQ

## Where is my download saved?
To the location you choose in the Save dialog. The app saves a single ZIP named like `<project name> - <SELECTION> - svg2icon.zip`.

## How are folders named inside the ZIP?
`{project}_{selection}` (for example: `AcmeLogo_web`). If a folder already exists, a ` (n)` suffix is added to keep it unique.

## What does “All” include?
`web/`, `desktop/`, `mobile/` (iOS + Android), and `svg/` (original).

## I don’t see an ICNS file.
ICNS may not be included on all systems. If it’s missing, use the PNG sizes (and ICO on Windows) or generate the package on a system that supports ICNS.

## Can I rename a project later?
Yes. Open the Actions menu on the row and choose Edit, then change the name and save.

## How do I replace the SVG for a project?
Edit the project, click Replace SVG, select a new file, then save changes.

## Can project names contain special characters?
Use letters, numbers, space, dot, dash, and underscore. If a duplicate exists, a suffix is added when saving.

## Do I need an internet connection?
No. Generating icons and saving ZIPs works offline.

## Where are settings like theme and analytics stored?
They’re saved locally and persist between sessions on the same machine.

## How do I change themes or privacy settings?
Open Settings from the header and choose a theme or toggle Privacy & Analytics.
