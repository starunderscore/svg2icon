# Optimizing SVGs

Keep files clean for faster, more predictable exports.

Recommendations:
- Remove metadata and editor‑specific attributes
- Convert text to paths when appropriate
- Flatten unnecessary groups and transforms
- Check fills and strokes at small sizes

Use any standard SVG optimizer you’re comfortable with.
