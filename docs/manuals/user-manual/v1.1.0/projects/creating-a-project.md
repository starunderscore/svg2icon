# Creating a Project

## Name the project
Enter a name you’ll recognize later. The name can use letters, numbers, spaces, dot, dash, and underscore.

> Remember: Project names use filename-safe characters — letters, numbers, space, dot, dash, and underscore.

> Tip: If a name already exists, you’ll see an error. When you save, the app adds a suffix like " (n)" to keep names unique.

## Save
Click Create Project to save.
