# Creating a Project

Create a project by adding your SVG and confirming a name. The flow is steady and predictable so you can focus on the file, not the UI.

## Add your SVG
Open “New SVG”, then drag in a file or use the file picker.

> Tip: You can switch between the drop area and the preview before saving.

## Name the project
The name auto‑fills from the filename. Adjust it to something clear and searchable if you like.

Short names make the table easier to scan.

## Create the project
Click “Create Project”. A notification appears in the bottom‑right and your project shows up in the table as a new row.

> Remember: You can download the original SVG later from the row’s “SVG” button.

## Save
Click “Create Project” to save your new project.
