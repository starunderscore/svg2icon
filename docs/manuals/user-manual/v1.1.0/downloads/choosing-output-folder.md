# Choosing Output Folder

After you click a download option, choose where to save.

What happens:
- The app creates a bundle named `{project}_{selection}` inside the folder you pick
- If that name already exists, it adds ` (n)` so nothing gets overwritten
- A notification appears in the bottomâ€‘right for success or any errors
