# Mobile Icons

Generate ready‑to‑use iOS and Android icon sets from your project.

Output folder: `mobile/`
- `ios-icons/` — iOS sizes
- `android-icons/` — Android densities

## Choose Mobile
From the project row, click the Mobile download to create the mobile package ZIP.

## Save the ZIP
Choose where to save. The file name follows your selection:
- Folder name inside the ZIP: `{project}_mobile` (a ` (n)` suffix is added if a folder already exists)

 

## Extract and use
Open the ZIP, then go to `mobile/`:
- `ios-icons/` contains iOS icon sizes
- `android-icons/` contains Android launcher densities

> Tip: Keep your original SVG handy (download from the project row’s “SVG” button) if you plan to update the icon later.
