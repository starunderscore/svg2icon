## Packages at a glance
- Web — Favicons and touch icons for sites/PWAs (includes HTML tags).
- Mobile — Full iOS and Android sets, named and sized for stores.
- Desktop — Common PNG sizes; ICO/ICNS when supported.
- All‑In‑One — Everything above in one output folder.

## What you get
- Clean folders per target (e.g., `web`, `mobile`, `desktop`).
- Consistent filenames and sizes used by each platform.
- A zip file you choose the save location for.

## Tips
- Start with a square SVG and ample padding.
- Check small sizes (16–32px) for clarity; simplify shapes if needed.
- Keep text out of the SVG unless it’s outlined.
