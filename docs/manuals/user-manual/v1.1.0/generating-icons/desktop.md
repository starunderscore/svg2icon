# Desktop Icons

Generate common desktop PNG sizes, plus Windows ICO and macOS ICNS when supported.

Output folder: `desktop/`
- PNG sizes for desktop use
- `icon.ico` (Windows)
- `icon.icns` (macOS, when supported)

## Choose Desktop
From the project row, click the Desktop download to create the desktop package ZIP.

> Technical Stuff: Platform icon availability
> Some platform icon formats (like ICNS) may not be included on all systems. If a format is missing, your PNGs and any available ICO remain usable.
