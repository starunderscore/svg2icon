# Desktop Icons

Generate common desktop PNG sizes, plus Windows ICO and macOS ICNS when supported.

Output folder: `desktop/`
- PNG sizes for desktop use
- `icon.ico` (Windows)
- `icon.icns` (macOS, when supported)

## Choose Desktop
From the project row, click the Desktop download to create the desktop package ZIP.

## Save the ZIP
Choose where to save. The ZIP is named:
`<project name> - Desktop - svg2icon.zip` (a ` (n)` suffix is added if a file with the same name already exists).
 

## Extract and use
Open the ZIP, then go to `desktop/` to find PNGs and platform icon files.

> Technical Stuff: Some platform icon formats (like ICNS) may not be included on all systems. If a format is missing, your PNGs and any available ICO remain usable.
